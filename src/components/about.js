            <p>
              I'm a front-end developer graduated from Centennial College as a
              software engineer in 2022. I have hands-on experience with .Net
              and Linux system. My interest in web development stems from my
              desire to continue learning and developing myself. I love problem
              solving and figuring out ways to tackle an issue.
